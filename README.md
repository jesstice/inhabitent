## Lessons Learned
- One of the main challenges during this project was understanding the template hierarchy structure, and how the various pieces were connected. Having gone through the process of putting this project together, I now have a much better grasp of the WordPress structure.
- This project contained a lot of CSS to style the various pages. In future, I would take more time in the planning stages to review the design comps to map out similar design pages and styles. I think this decrease the amount of time spent on CSS, and help ensure the styling is consistent.
- During this project, I encountered a few problems I needed to solve. In the process of coming to a solution, I noticed that I have a tendency to think three steps ahead and overcomplicate the solution. I realized that I need to take things one step at a time.
